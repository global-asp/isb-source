# A Year in Edmonton

##
It is spring.

##
Coyote plays in the mud.

##
Wash off, Coyote!

##
It is summer.

##
It is hot and sunny.

##
Donâ€™t get burnt!

##
It is autumn.

##
The leaves are yellow.

##
Coyotes are not yellow!

##
It is freeze-up.

##
Coyote is cold.

##
Find a house, Coyote.

##
It is winter.

##
Coyote explores.

##
Hare is hidden.

##
It is break-up.

##
The ice is thin.

##
Stay safe, Coyote!

##
It is spring.

##
Coyote is old.
