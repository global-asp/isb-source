# Everything Has a Colour

##
The river is blue.

##
The clouds are white.

##
The sun is yellow.

##
The land is green.

##
The flowers are pink.

##
The orange tree is orange.

##
My shirt is red.

##
The dirt is brown.

##
Now the clouds are grey. Will it rain?

##
The rainbow has many colours. Can you name them?

##
The sun is setting. The sky is now red.

##
That helicopter is purple with pink spots.

##
The fire is orange and red. Be careful!

##
The night sky is black, and the stars are white.
