# Source stories from the Indigenous Storybooks collection in Markdown format

This repository makes available the source texts of stories from [Indigenous Storybooks](https://indigenousstorybooks.ca) in Markdown format. The stories have been translated into a growing number of Indigenous languages as well as English, French, and Spanish (and a small number of community translations in various other languages).

All of the source texts derive from the [Little Cree Books](http://littlecreebooks.com/) project, and were originally written in Plains Cree, Swampy Cree, and English. The markdown files in this repo provide data for several other projects, as well as making possible the creation of bilingual storybooks in many languages.

## Structure

Each of the folders in the repository is labelled with a (usually two- or three-letter) code that represents the language it is written in (e.g. `crk` for Plains Cree). A list of available languages and their codes is [below](#languages).

Each story has also been assigned a four digit number for ease of identification. There is a full list of the stories by number [below](#stories).

Each of the language folders in the repository contains a series of files containing all of the translations of the story in that language in Markdown format.

## Format

The extracted source text of all stories has been provided here in Markdown format. See [here](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp#source-format) for specific details about the format used.

A sequence of two hashes `##` on a separate line indicates a page break.

The last section of each story file contains attribution and license information.
